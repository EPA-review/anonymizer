He seems to appreciate that the time away was needed to get settled with the changes in his life and he does feel that he has been doing better since he returned. Upon reviewing his EPAs I noted that since his return he had received an exceptionally high number [5/week] of observations (aided by being on EM and working with some faculty who provide good feedback). All of the EPAs he received during this period were quite positive. From an academic perspective, he is planning to continue work on the dashboard project with plans to begin drafting the first manuscript over the next several weeks.

Stu had mesenteric ischemia on his DDx because of 'pain out of proportion', but the rest of the story/risk factors/vitals did not fit with that diagnosis.  I explained that even when you suspect mesenteric ischemia, it will be the ultimate diagnosis in less than half the cases, so we needed to consider other things.

She did a good job acknowledging the stressful situation, asked all the relevant questions related to pregnancy history, did an US to look for pregnancy and ordered appropriate investigations.  I prompted Haley to check for free fluid when she found NDIUP on US.  She documented indeterminate rather than NDIUP on the chart.  I prompted her to check a blood type on the patient before discharge, even though the patient did not have PV bleeding.

Haley was mindful to consider alternative diagnoses other than pregnancy related.

I think it would have been better to do this case as a case - in real time, how did the case play out, get the audience to manage all aspects of it.  

The eventual diagnosis was Spontaneous Cardiac Artery Dissection.  This is a very rare presentation.  The audience is very unlikely to remember anything about the specifics of pathophysiology, treatment and prognosis.  It's also much more important for the audience to focus on making the diagnosis, rather than specifics about the disease.  I would suggest getting the audience to gather all of the data (take the history questions, ask what tests they would do) and then reveal the diagnosis.  Focus on how you think we can make this diagnosis in the future (which you did).  The launch into a topic took away a bit from the effectiveness of this talk.

She had a young female with acute on sub-acute LLQ pain that she wanted an US for a possible ovarian cyst, on a Sunday morning.  The Radiologist tried to convince her to not do the study, but Haley was persistent yet professional in her request.  The study got done and the patient had a hemorrhagic cyst that required follow-up imaging in a couple of weeks.

We discussed strategies for this in the future:
1. Give only what you are looking for and what imaging study you want, avoid the H&P.  Radiologists are not clinicians, so they should not be talking you out of a diagnosis that you are worried about.  It is in their realm to more suggest an alternative modality for the diagnosis in question.
2. They are unlikely to refuse a study, but rather try to get you to withdraw the request.  Try to stay quiet.

This was challenging in this case as the family physician was not incredibly clear on her initial presentation with what the injuries and concerns were. She was able to come up with a reasonable plan for bringing the patient to Saskatoon for further imaging given what was known from the community ED. In her presentation to the emergency physician she could have been more concise, however, I suspect that this partially stems from her inexperience with these calls and our system in terms of knowing what exactly was required. Regardless, I she provided all information that was required for an effective consultation the the community ED and consultation from the accepting EM physician.||FALSE

In the first case the physician was very uncomfortable with the clinical situation, but given that they were 2 hours away you have to coach them through the basics of trauma care (hemorrhage control).  

In the second case, the sending facility is equivalent in terms of time for ground (ALS) and STARS.  It was a good decision for the Transport Doc to use STARS as the patient was still receiving care (ground crew could not leave until patient was back from CT) and the patient was complex (intubated, running infusions).  In most other situations, going with ground from this centre makes more sense - same travel time, keeps our critical care resource available.

Young severely injured female blunt trauma patient requiring aggressive management of multiple life threatening injuries.  Primary survey tasks alone included: initiation of massive transfusion-airway control-treatment of tension pneumothorax-recognition of free abdo fluid-recognition/treatment of pelvic fracture.  Recognition and management of a severe head injury, severe shock state initially due to tension pneumothorax and then intraabdominal injury was key as well as physiologically difficult airway management.   A key point was that survival was unlikely it the patient was transported to a trauma center without initial damage control laparotomy. Dr. Benjamin performed very well in this scenario and navigated the multiple acute life threats appropriately while competently leading his sim team.

Woods|Clinical Supervisor|4|Part A: Direct and Indirect Observation - Form 1||"Ponn assessed a patient who had been brought in by EMS with altered mental status.  Bystanders called when this older patient was found in a ditch.  There was not a lot to go on as the patient was essentially screaming with visible signs of trauma.  I listened as Ponn received the EMS report, and Ponn presented his findings/plan to me.  Ponn synthesized the H&P well, then had a DDx that was categorical: structural intra-cranial, tox, infectious, metabolic.  He reported that there was not much 'collaborative history' (he meant collateral).  I pushed him a bit to see what might fit best and he couldn't narrow it down anymore.  I encouraged Ponn to get collateral history - he contacted the brother by phone.  

When Ponn contacted the brother, he used a bit of medical jargon (your brother was brought in by 'EMS').  He also didn't set the stage very well.  When a family member receives a call from a hospital, the first thing they think is that their family member is dead or dying.  Start with who you are and that you are looking after their family member, and that they are sick but they are stable and we need your help to look after them.  You need as much past history to try and piece together what might have happened to them.  Otherwise it can be confusing for the family.  

With the collateral history not much help, I pushed him to see if he thought an intra-cranial bleed would present like this, and he reported that it would be unlikely, which I agreed with, but this took some prompting.  This was more of a delirium or intoxication type of presentation.  In the end the patient was intoxicated.

I think Ponn would have safely managed this patient on his own, however his thought process needs to be more polished with this type of patient complaint, as it is a common one for ED physicians."||FALSE

He was going to do a cardiac work-up and consult after the Troponin was back.  I reviewed the ECG and confirmed his findings and needed to prompt him to order a repeat ECG in 20-30 minutes to check for dynamic ECG changes.  The repeat ECG showed worsening ST depression in multiple lead with ST elevation in aVR.  Ponn correctly identified this as either Left Main or triple vessel disease.  He started Heparin/Plavix and consulted Cardio.

In his documentation, the initial plan said 'ECG looks suspicious for NSTEMI'.  This needs to be cleaned up as an ECG does not make a diagnosis of NSTEMI, rather elevated biomarkers do.

The parent, as well as my major concern was the limited intake and purging situation, and that should have been management priority in my view. We needed to talk through the issues for me to generate an understanding of concerns and priority.

He has a good plan for this upcoming year in terms of ED rotations and international work.||FALSE
2018-11-29|Ponn Benjamin|P7|Mark Taylor|Clinical Supervisor|5|Part A: Review of resident submission - Form 4||Dr. Benjamin has continued to make progress in all areas that have previously been addressed during his remediation. His clinical reasoning has gotten a lot better, as has his ability to manage patients in the ED in an effective manner. Most importantly, I'm proud of the fact that he has taken such a big ownership of things over the last year and continued to put in the effort and work to improve. He has identified some important goals for the next six months and we will continue to work towards getting better.||FALSE
2019-06-03|Ponn Benjamin|P7|Mark Taylor|Clinical Supervisor|5|Part A: Review of resident submission - Form 4||"It is a great relief that Ponn passed his remedial ICU rotation and a big step in his residency journey. The last several months have been somewhat stressful for Ponn as he prepared diligently for this rotation. He knew that there would be a lot riding on his performance and that a fail would likely lead to more remediation. He spent a significant amount of time and energy asking others for guidance (staff, fellow residents etc), as well as reading around presentations and areas that are commonly seen in the ICU setting.  He took it very seriously and there is no doubt in my mind that he prepared as well as he could for this. He received a ‘pass’ on his rotation, which is great news for him and it is definitely deserved. He is aware that the program was hoping for him to be ‘above average and excel’ on the rotation but it cannot be stated enough that he performed to the best of his abilities. 

Ponn and I spent a lot of time over the last couple months discussing the upcoming Royal College Exam. We weighed the pros and cons of writing in 2020 vs 2021..provided he was given the choice by the program. The difference in time would only be a couple months given the fact that Ponn has 6 months remediation already. As he is an independent adult learner, I ultimately said the decision was up to him (again, if the program was giving him the choice). He has chosen to write in 2021. Having more time to prepare for both the written and oral will really benefit Ponn in my opinion. I will be sure to include him in exam prep starting Sept 2019.

Despite having multiple remediation blocks and hurdles, Ponn has continued to improve in his abilities as an emergency medicine clinician. I have personally witnessed him being much more calm, developing better approaches to cases, and getting more well versed in medical literature. He commented in his review, as well as to me personally, that he is feeling disheartened and frustrated about some of the comments that have been made regarding his skills while meeting with residency leadership. I think Ponn is feeling very stigmatized b/c of the difficulties he has had to go through in the past couple of years as a resident. It is my hope that since he has passed all remediations that the program concentrates on continuing to make him a competent clinician…as opposed to an “excellent” one. It has been extremely stressful on Ponn and his family and the most difficult years are still ahead unfortunately. We need to continue to be supportive and nourish his growth. 

In terms of goals for the next 3 months, Ponn and I will work to determine a schedule for reading/exam prep. Also, I strongly encouraged him to pick up some more shifts with the program and assistant program directors – as he needs to display some of his improvements to them on shift."||FALSE

Post sedation the patient briefly obstructed without desaturation requiring jaw thrust.  Things were being managed 'ok' by the RT but needed a little encouragement to be more aggressive with positioning and jaw thrust to overcome the obstruction.  Had I not said anything in this case specifically, the patient would have likely been fine as the medications were wearing off.   My advice for Sachin is to make sure he know that he is in charge in the sedation, and he should be proactive in directing his team if things are not going as they should to ensure an optimal patient outcome.

Patient went apneic and so attempts to reduce were initiated but we were struggling to find the sweet spot b/w apnea and adequate sedation. 
two main learning points:
1) we found the ortho team a little impatient - we had to prompt them several times to back off while we titrated up. 
2) choice of titration agent - we discussed the merits of propofol vs ketamine for rapid and predictable titration.

The local EMS service was BLS and air ambulance can only fly to a nearby community.  Sachin knew that the 2 options were to have an ALS ambulance come from that other community OR to have a staff member trained in ACLS to accompany the patient.  The sending physician was a bit overwhelmed and kept interrupting making the interaction inefficient.  Sachin was able to navigate the phone call safely.

He has done ~ 10 femoral and IJ CVLs up this point.  I had to talk him through the technique and give him some tips on landmarking, how to angle his needle, and how far to bury the needle in order to cannulate the vein.  It's a bit counter-intuitive how you angle the needle too keep it from diving deep, but after feedback Sachin understood and was able to use the technique successfully.  He was able to access the vein within a few minutes and use Seldinger technique to complete the procedure.  Sachin gathered all of his own supplies for the procedure and had everything ready.

He did an excellent field block and the patient tolerated the procedure very well. I was in and out of the room. I helped make Sachin make the call to sit the patient up where he had immediate success. Otherwise I would advise him in the future to angle the needle so that its pointing more cephalad.

He navigated the feedback encounter well.  Did it in the back room, asked the learner how the shift went.  Gave general positive feedback, gave some specific things he did well (charting disposition plans) and what he could work on (making sure he charted his patients after each encounter so he didn't forget key H+P data).

He covered a manageable scope of content (laundry pods and button batteries) and explained concepts well.  I would recommend he make the following adjustments for future TOPIC presentations:
1. Change your key words in your objectives.  'Understand' 'be able to' are weak words to use.  Think about what you want your audience to be able to do when you are done.  Some good suggestions: List, compare and contrast, describe, apply.  There are many resources on line for what makes a good objective.
2. Using cases in a topic presentation are good, however don't turn your topic presentation into a mini case presentation as this distracts your audience from the objectives you are trying to get across.  Assume basic data gathering/resuscitation will be done.  Focus your questions related to the case on the objective you are trying to get across.  So don't do the whole 'med student, off-service, EM resident' escalation to manage all aspects of the case.  Do that in a case presentation.  Go with 'what are the specific differences in management you would employ in this case knowing it is a caustic ingestion'.
3. If you put a complex flow chart, use some technique to highlight the aspect of the flow chart you are discussing (want the audience's attention on).  You can use screen shots of individual boxes, then overlay them on the bigger chart through slide transitions, or if the flow-chart is relatively small and easy to read, highlight the box with an arrow or box shape.  If you put up a confusing/complex flow chart, high chance of losing your audiences attention.  Several people's eyes went to their phone when these slides went up."||FALSE

Woods|Clinical Supervisor|4|Part A: Direct and Indirect Observation - Form 1||"Sachin reviewed the majority of patient cases with his student, while also seeing some of his own patients.  Midway through the shift, Sachin felt a bit overwhelmed as several patients of his own and his trainees patients were ready to be re-assessed at a similar time.  He felt guilty that he was not able to see a lot of new patients.  I explained to him that this is to be expected.  At 3 hours into the shift, we had seen collectively 18 patients.  It is ok at that point to not pick up anyone new for an hour or so and make sure the patients you have seen have clear dispositions.  Then pick up less complex patients for the rest of the shift.  We ended up seeing close to 30 people, which is well above average for a shift.  I gave Sachin the feedback that he needs to make sure he has a clear plan with everyone, and not just see numbers.  One of the patients he reviewed with the student he recognized that he could have spent more time with initially, as he realized later that additional testing was required that he did not appreciate after a quick review with the student.

In terms of Sachin's teaching, he took time to teach around every case, and the student was quite appreciative of Sachin's expertise and patience.  Sachin let the trainee debrief at the end of the shift.  He started by asking the student how the shift went and out came one of the most insightful self-assessments I have ever heard.  Sachin followed up with some feedback.  I think it could have been more specific.  I would encourage Sachin to try and choose ONE or TWO very specific things for the trainee to do differently next time.  This could be procedural, cognitive, clinical reasoning, knowledge, communication.  Overall Sachin managed a shift with a trainee very well."||FALSE

2018-10-25|Riley Hartmann|C1|Alison Turnquist|Clinical Supervisor|3|Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1|emergency department, senior, complex clinical characteristic, shock|Riley has all the medical knowledge necessary to manage patients in shock.  He is very medically competent in this area.  He needed prompting only to guide what order things should happen in the resus, and how to move everything along quickly.  This pt with a massive PE was very sick, and normally I would have brought in another physician to help with all the things needing to get done (lines, etc) however with Riley we were able to do it together.  Where he needs to work is just getting repeated exposures and practice seeing sick patients so he is comfortable with what needs to happen when and more efficiently synthesize the information coming to him.  Sims will help with this. Also, Riley don't be too hard on yourself, you haven't been able to manage many resus' yet, and this is a HUGE cognitive load to manage, the only thing you need is practice and you will be phenomenal.  We don't expect you to manage this alone at this point.||FALSE

Effectively verbalizing and communicating the ABCDE, performing a bedside eFAST in a timely fashion. Going up to CT with the patient and collaborating with RT,Anesthesia and the RN's. Also managing analgesics in a 5 month old that could be challenging (provided sucrose, a pacifier that worked really well, in addition to Fentanyl PRN's when needed). He also debirded the burns and dressed them appropriately. He was calm and empathetic towards the family during this difficult time. I would also like to commend Riley for correcting some of the information I was personally relaying to plastics surgery over the phone. This speaks a lot about his professionalism and wanting to amend mistakes/ errors /miscommunication that he witnesses in the ED.||FALSE

2019-04-16|Riley Hartmann|C4|Faisal Alsani|Clinical Supervisor|4|Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1|child, emergency department, complex patient characteristic|Riley was given the opportunity to perform three procedural sedations in the pediatircs emergency department over 2 back to back shifts we had together. These were all children with fractures (a 5 year old ~9 year old and a teenager). I closely observed in all three cases how exceptional Riley's communication was with the families and patients explaining what ER sedations are and the medications he was going to use with possible adverse reactions.  He obtained and documented all the necessary clinical information needed for sedations and collaborated really well with orthopaedics, emergency nurses and respiratory therapists. I recall one particular thing that stands out in Riley's care in these 3 cases; one child started to have a few apneas while being sedated (despite giving a safe dose of Ketamine and Propofol), Riley communicated his concerns to the team in a skillful manner and decided that the safest thing to do was to abort this sedation. This reflects Riley's understanding and awareness of the limitations of procedural sedations in the pediatircs emergency setting. This particular child with apneas ended up going to the OR the next day but was admitted for a longer period post operatively due to apneas and is being worked up for OSA.||FALSE

Woods|Clinical Supervisor|3|Part A: Direct and Indirect Observation - Form 1|emergency department, adult, complex patient characteristic, other|Riley introduced himself to the patient and family, and took a history through a family member/interpreter.  I gave a few tips:  neuro exam (how to coach a patient through finger nose testing, and to ensure the patient's arm is fully extended when touching your finger), and to use the term 'is your cancer thought to be curable' to have the conversation around goals of care in a cancer patient.  Riley appropriately determined that the patient's symptoms were likely due to swelling of brain mets, but needed a little push to treat with steroids before discussing with consultant.||FALSE

In fact, I would say Riley could independently practice safely, not just because of his knowledge, but because he is self aware of limitations.  An example of this is that when this seizing febrile post partum patient came in, the nurses got you in the room to manage it and not just me. All your labs, dosages, and ongoing care was appropriate.  I put had to prompt only because I think you can own the room and lead more confidently.  For example, I felt in the room there were pauses and I had to ask a couple times what you'd like or when the nurses asked what you'd like done, I had to defer it to you.  You stated you were hesitant to LP because you had only done one ""three times"".  All the more reason to do it!!! That's our job to make sure you are safe. 
You are at the stage in training where we as staff should be sitting back and letting you run the show, so feel free to take charge with orders and talk out loud about your thought process.  To facilitate this, at the start of shift, you can say to the staff that if there are sick people I'd like to take the lead and practice confidently leading.  Sometimes staff are hesitant because we are so type A, if you are finding that, talk out loud about your thought process to show them you are managing it (like sim).  I felt the only limitation here was confidence.  You don't have to know everything, or even have seen everything before to be confident managing things, you just need to know how you will find the answers and be safe about it.  Your clinical reasoning is strong, so lean in, own it, and be ok with some things being unknown.  This gets easier with practice."||FALSE

He was aware of the possible concerns of a rapid SVT being a VT and the failings of all scoring systems to distinguish between them. He noted the features that could be consistent with VT. He appropriately sought cardiology consultation without prompting and knew why. I am confident that he could have managed this patient safely and independently.||FALSE

I encouraged him to look from the other perspective: 33 y o, first presentation 'psychosis' is unlikely to be primarily psychiatric.  Not a slam dunk psychiatric admission.  Riley then gathered further history to determine that the patient was not likely to be psychotic, but had real reasons for paranoia but was having excessive anxiety about the people he was worried were out to get him.

2018-11-23|Riley Hartmann|C17|Robert A. Woods|Clinical Supervisor|5|Part A: Direct Observation - Form 4||Riley did a nice job of teaching around each case.  He probably tries to teach a little too much detail at times (ie. drugs that can be dialyzed, drugs that have entero-hepatic circulation).  When you teach too much, they may remember even less.  It is tempting to share your level of knowledge, but is far advanced to their level of experience.  Try and keep it a bit simpler.  Nice job on the end of shift feedback.  Work on being as specific as possible, and avoid platitudes (ie. good job on differentials can be modified to had a good differential for abdo pain in a 90 y o female, considered all life threatening causes).  I really liked you specific feedback about having a sense of disposition after each encounter, although that might be a big ask for a new JURSI.

2018-12-06|Riley Hartmann|C17|Lynsey Martin|Clinical Supervisor|5|Part A: Direct Observation - Form 4||"Riley had 2 clinical shifts with me and a medical student (Dec 1 & 2) as part of his longitudinal education block 
He did a great job assessing where the learner was at with his knowledge and then tailoring the cases/teaching he provided over the two days to the learner. On the first shift, he would occasionally interrupt the learner during presentations to ask questions, but then tailored his practice on the subsequent shift to allow the learner to fully present the case then asked his clarifying questions/would teach around cases. He appropriately reviewed the learner's patients at the bedside and reviewed all investigations/notes himself. Unfortunately, we didn't have any procedures for Riley to supervise. At the conclusion of the shifts each day, Riley provided good constructive feedback to the learner and completed the shift feedback form. 
Feedback from me (as well as from the medical student on shift) is that Riley is a great teacher and breaks teaching down into smaller concepts that are easier for the learner to process. Going forward, I have encouraged Riley to 1) get comfortable with learners doing more (e.g. instead of calling a consultant yourself, go through with the learner how to make a good consult and get comfortable supervising/giving feedback on this) 2) When you find it difficult to find a teaching topic for a learner/teaching point for a case, differentials, interpretations skills (CXR, ECG) and soft skills/communication are always good points to review."||FALSE
2019-02-25|Riley Hartmann|C17|Lynsey Martin|Clinical Supervisor|5|Part A: Direct Observation - Form 4||"I supervised Riley teaching a group of first year medical students an approach to respiratory issues in the ED 

Riley arrived to the session early, consented and ED patient to participate in the session and ensured patient comfort throughout the session. Prior to the patient encounter, he checked in with the students to know what level they were at and provided a quick review of an approach to resp in the ED to focus the session. 

He supervised the students taking history & performing physical exam and offered specific feedback during the session to ensure they asked the appropriate questions and performed all of the necessary exam. He then debriefed and provided an approach to the patient's differential, investigations and treatments. He also went through CXR approach for the patient as well as for example cases. 

Overall, Riley did a fantastic job with this session. The students had glowing feedback for him for the teaching he received. One of the things Riley has been working on is teaching to the student's level as he sometimes provides ""high level information to junior learners"". I thought he did a fantastic job breaking down information and not going into too much detail and hitting home the concepts these learners needed to know. 

Going forward, only main piece of feedback is to get the learners to try and present the case and their differential first before going through your approach as this will force them to critically think about the differential and their case presentation.

Potential suggestions for future consideration could include explaining why the mnemonics were included (was it to help them study? were these things that he thought needed memorization?).

He reviewed all of their cases and taught around each case.  He looked for opportunities for teaching - brought them in on a trauma, supervised them doing an US.  I observed Quinn deliver a short teaching session on how to do a primary survey which was very effective.  He pointed out the deficiencies of the JR resident who performed it, but was not critical simply pointing out that they were learning too and needed more experience.  There was one case where the student wanted to a CXR for abdominal pain.  I could tell Quinn felt it was not needed based on what he had heard.  In the end, the gut feeling of the student (that the patient was sick) was correct - they evolved and had appendicitis, was not conveyed effectively.  I shared with Quinn that these situations are an excellent opportunity for advocacy inquiry.  'Based on what you have told me, I would not order a CXR in this patient.  What are you thinking about that would make you want to order one?'  This way you can get into their frame, then work on getting the student to present this impression more effectively.

This is an unusual spectrum for a trainee to be on, as they are usually on target or overconfident, so a good trainee 'type' to have a teaching shift with.  He took opportunities to get procedural opportunities for his trainee (Suturing, bedside US, nasal packing).  He was able to give one specific piece of feedback at the end of the shift.

2019-02-12|Quinten Paterson|C17|Lynsey Martin|Clinical Supervisor|5|Part A: Direct Observation - Form 4||"I observed Quinten teaching a pre-clerkship session for 1st year medical students at city hospital on Feb 12, 2019. He is very passionate about medical education and definitely excels in this domain. 

Quinten arrived early to city hospital to look for patients presenting to the department that could be interviewed/examined as part of the session and came up with a plan for how to organize the session so as to balance content he wanted to cover with the logistics of allowing ED flow to continue (e.g. asked a patient to participate and then met with the group to discuss logistics of the session/cover some teaching points while the patient was getting initial assessment in the ED and then brought the students in for their patient interview/exam afterwards). This allowed the session to run smoothly and showed his maturity and experience with running these types of sessions. 

Quinten did a great job of eliciting the students' approach to history and physical exam and teaching around abdominal pain differential diagnoses. He did a great job of probing the students' knowledge in these domains and supplementing it as required. He also discussed different diagnostic modalities for investigating abdominal pain. He concluded the session by providing each student with a piece of targeted feedback on what they did well in today's session and allowed the learners to self-assess one thing they will work on going forward. 

Two pieced of feedback for Quinten going forward 
1) Take the time to enquire where the students are at with their knowledge/what they have covered before the session - e.g. have they covered the abdo system yet as this will allow you to tailor the session (we discussed how teaching to junior learners gets harder the further away from medical school you get). 

2) Quinten discussed case presentations with the students. He gave a great example of one using the patient they had seen in the ED> I encouraged Quinten to allow the students to try and present first & then give feedback or give an example using a different case and then allow them to practice presenting using their patient. In this session, the students basically repeated back what Quinten had said so to allow them to go through the process themselves may have enhanced their learning.

2018-10-10|Seyara Shwetz|C18|Robert A. Woods|Clinical Supervisor|3|Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1||"Sey chose an excellent case to discuss at AHD.  It was a patient who had a critical illness with lots of opportunities for the audience to add discussion.  It nicely demonstrated a lot of important resuscitation interventions in the Pediatric population and I think the audience did benefit from hearing about it.  The question about 'how to bring your attending up to speed' was great.  This is an important skill that we don't teach well.  Instead of SOAP, you could also use the SBAR mnemonic.  In the end there was limited participation from the audience, which is not what we want to see in a case.  I would recommend the following for future presentations:

1. Be careful not to 'call people out'.  Before the talk started, you warned the audience, that 'they would need to do a lot of the talking'.  Consider re-phrasing this to, 'this was a challenging case for me, and I want to hear all of your opinions/expertise on how you would have managed it'.  The latter is less intimidating and invites more participation.  Similarly at the end of the talk, you made a comment how 'I ended up doing most of the talking'.  It can come across as patronizing.  I think another good stimulus question would be around accessing the EHR.  You stated that you did this, but ask people if they would do anything before going into the room.  If one of the audience suggests it rather than you, it will be more memorable for the audience.  

2. Don't be afraid of silence.  If you ask a question, wait for at least 30 seconds before you give the answer away.  Diffusion of responsibility will dictate that if there are 30 people in the room, every participant will think that it's someone else's job to answer.  Your audience is also uncomfortable with silence.  If you wait long enough, someone will offer a response, even if it is just to move the talk along as nobody wants a talk to run overtime.  When people do offer suggestions, thank them, praise their suggestion ('great idea'), get them to explore why they wanted to manage a certain way.  This encourages more participation from others.

3. Be careful how you navigate having a difference in opinion with your attending and sharing this information with a group of residents.  Skill in bedside ultrasound is not ubiquitous and not considered standard of care, particularly in Peds ER.  They way you played out the case, it could be interpreted that you gelt you were the more competent person in the room and that perhaps your attending lacks competence to care for sick children.  Even if you were, it's not for you to decide that you are.  Respect the hierarchy.  If you had avoided the comments about the preceptor being 'over the top' in regards to their heightened level of supervision earlier in the shift, the conflict you had with them about fluid boluses and use of US would have been received better by the audience (a difference of opinion in the moment in an acute situation), and less likely to be interpreted as a lack of competence."||FALSE

-Progress of the year's to-do's going well. Will get imagesim done before PEM
-EPA numbers/week down in the last 3 month period secondary to two off-service rotations (IM and plastics) where they were more difficult to get filled out. Still progressing at a good clip.
-No specifically concerning EPA's in Core. Discussed last 2 EPA's completed on 3.1. Justin noted that he didn't feel they went well but that he learned a lot from them and the feedback he received. I provided reassurance that lower ratings on these EPAs early in 2nd year are completely normal and should not be at all taken as discouraging! Will complete this EPA 34 more times so lots of time for improvement. 
-In general, discussed the need to avoid EPA 3.10 and focus on EPAs 3.11 and 3.15 whenever possible. Also encouraged him to have his research attendings complete EPA 3.20 after he completes each scholarly project as the feedback on his scholarly projects will only benefit him as he builds his academic career.
-Continued to discuss the best way to engage others with different beliefs regarding topics that some consider controversial. Given his academic ambitions, it is likely that this is something that he will need to continue to work at. Recommended that he take the ASSET course and review Jenny Rudolph's papers on debriefing with good judgement / no such thing as nonjudgmental debriefing to learn about advocacy-inquiry as a potential engagement technique for difficult conversations.
-Overall, I agree that Justin is progressing as expected clinically with substantially accelerated progress across academic domains such as teaching and research."||FALSE
2019-06-05|Justin Koh|P7|Brent Thoma|Clinical Supervisor|5|Part A: Review of resident submission - Form 4||From my perspective, Justin continues to excel during residency. He seems to be managing to balance his academic and MPH work and his clinical/educational responsibilities. He has received a research award and had a workshop accepted for ICRE in addition to publications. I find that our meetings are quite productive, largely because of his motivation to improve - he regularly integrates suggestions that I provide into his life. From an EPA perspective, he is still receiving observations at a very high rate and has a good understanding of what he needs to focus on (e.g. ultrasound observations) moving forward. His electives have been very helpful to him in consolidating his academic interests and future plans, with a potential unifying focus on motivation at the patient, provider, and system level. Overall, I believe he is progressing well clinically and being challenged/given the academic opportunities and support that he needs.||FALSE

I needed to prompt Justin to find out why the treatment was not working: failure to implement non-pharmacologic treatments (leg elevation) vs wrong ABX (ie. MRSA).

Mom was quite anxious, so I stepped into complete the procedure.  His landmarking and technique looked good to me, from my vantage point holding the infant.  The only tip I gave was with the speed of insertion.  Infants are wiggly and if you advance your needle quite slowly, the track created will be determined by the wiggly baby and not you.  Insert your needle in to the skin, landmark again to ensure you are centred between the spinous processes, ensure you are parallel with the floor and the child is properly positioned, then advance relatively quickly.

-Good overview of the objectives of the talk noting what would be covered and - importantly - what would not given the focused nature of the talk.
-Generally effective slides with some helpful demonstrative images (e.g. the colored waterfall). Consider cutting back your text-based slides even further. Unless you want the audience to read it, I don't think that it needs to be up there (you clearly knew what you were going to say without the text on the slide!).
-I'd encourage you to challenge yourself to interact with the audience even more. The more active you can make your lecture the better. Could you have illustrated some of the earlier concepts in your talk via a case like you did with the later elements? When you put out your case consider using a think/pair/share model before to allow everyone to discuss rather than the 1-2 people who field your question. The more active, the more it will improve what your audience takes away from the talk and is my biggest recommendation for how you'll become a better teacher in this particular context (a relatively small group lecture that CAN be interactive).
-I don't believe that you explicitly mentioned a formal needs assessment, but you provided some context regarding how and why it is important that indicated that you were thoughtful in the selection of the presented information.

Likely sim artifact.
-Reasonable start with vitals, IV's, nasal prongs, and ECG.
-ECG interpretation saw some ST changes but missed the 3rd degree AVB.
-Considered nitro but didn't give it due to lack of R sided ECG. This is not the reason you shouldn't have given it! BP was light, HR was ~40 when you mentioned this, and the patient had a 3rd degree block. I noted that I would prompt because I would have prompted based on this.
-Good call to your emergency physician. Lots of good information and in a good order with good brevity.
-Reasonable workup planned prior to consulting with the emergency physician. Notably, I mentioned a DOPAMINE infusion rather than a dobutamine infusion. Dobutamine probably wouldn't be appropriate in this situation as it could drop the blood pressure. You told me all about this when I came into the room so it's clear you knew it :)

In one particular child he was able to identify some red flags that warranted further investigation, he also looked up guidelines on syncope in children and used this to his advantage in providing evidence based standard of care to his patients. Andrew Broadened his DDX on Syncope that day, he effectively reassured families and communicated his discharge and follow up instructions really well.||FALSE

He correctly identified lateral STEMI, noticed ST depression in the anterior leads, got posterior leads and diagnosed postero-lateral STEMI.  He also took the initiative to put the US probe on the patient's lungs and identify diffuse B line pattern suspicious for CHF.  He didn't appreciate that the patient had q waves on his ECG, and the history was not great for acute MI but rather sub-acute MI.  The event likely happened a few days ago, and now the patient was in CHF.  We talked about the importance of noticing subtle aspects of the ECG (q wave development in addition to STEMI pattern), correlating ST elevation ECGs with patient histories, and appreciating that sinus tachycardia/low sats is unusual in an acute STEMI unless there is a mechanical complication.  We also discussed that had this patient been sicker, withholding anti-platelets initially might be a good idea in case they need urgent cardiac surgery to fix a valve lesion.  I gave him feedback on his phone calls.  He learned the logistics of how to get things going in a STEMI (Interventional Cardiologist on call, not the JR resident), and to be careful about communicating his US findings 'I couldn't look at the valves with my ECHO'.

He did a pre-sedation assessment and covered all key aspects to ensure it was safe to proceed.  He obtained verbal consent covering all relevant potential side-effects.  He chose to give pre-antiemetic medication, which is a good idea.  I chose the sedation medications ahead of time: Fentanyl and Propofol - he would have used Ketamine +/- Propofol.  I needed to help him work through dosing of the Fentanyl (~ 1mcg/kg).  He carefully titrated Propofol thereafter, however he could have been more aggressive in dosing to get more rapid sedation.  He was a bit premature in telling Ortho to go ahead with reduction - child was not quite sedated enough and I needed to prompt to give more medication before starting.  One way to tell is to ask Ortho to give some traction on the limb to get a sense of how deep they are - it will guide if they need more medication or not.  I am happy that Andrew is careful not to give too much medication as apnea is our main worry with this procedure. As he gets more experience he will get better at finding that sweet spot of sedation and completing the procedure safely AND efficiently - communicating with the Ortho team on where they are at in their procedure, anticipating when to give doses of medication (splint removal, reduction attempts, molding).  Andrew gave good discharge instructions. Keep working on different medication regimens so you are comfortable with lots of options down the road.||FALSE

He did a good job of the assessment. When presenting the plan he wavered between multiple options for management. He ultimately independently selected the right thing to do, but in the future I encouraged him to propose a treatment plan more quickly. While he ultimately knew what he needed to do, he talked through many options before coming to a conclusion and I worry that he wouldn't often be able to present in this way without his attending jumping in and agreeing with one of the ideas he came up with before he made a conclusion himself, limiting his learning. I made specific prompts regarding the order of things that needed to happen (analgesia before x-ray, calling plastics before splint to ensure they are on board with the plan - they ultimately just came to see).||FALSE

His history taking and identification of the issues were quite well done aside from not noting to me in the review that she was 10 months post partum (his notes identified this however). We had a lengthy discussion about whether or not she needed to see psychiatry in the ED and how consulting psych for social issues has major workload implications for our consultants. we instead consulted social work. My only feedback was to drill down her contact information as this would be vital to making an outpatient plan. I had to remind Andrew several times to ask if she had a phone number including after he made an outpatient plan for her. At the end of her ED stay we had to wait for her to go outside to find out her mom's contact info so we could safely follow through with our referral.

-When ordering the pacer pads placed I do think it is reasonable to be really explicit in terms of why right from the beginning (especially if the patient appears to be pretty stable). You asked for the defibrillator which does imply defibrillation rather than pacing which also resulted in some confusion.
-You were worried about needing to pace her and gave atropine but didn't order an ECG until after! ECG can happen (along with blood work) simultaneously with the history and physical exam in a patient who is sick like this one. Your nurse was free during the physical exam and could have been helping with this. I would have definitely prompted for an ECG much earlier.
-Ordered atropine to be given prior to an ECG and also used some language noting that you were uncertain regarding its dose. This did not convey confidence and I suspect that the nurses would be quite concerned regarding this patient with unstable vitals and not knowing the doses for the medications for the resuscitation medications that are being ordered. This should prompt you to get help quicker.
-When giving verbal orders of labs I would suggest using 'workups' rather than specifics otherwise they will be missed!
-Call to me - good job on noting that you needed help and giving vitals but you could give me a bit more of an interpretation of what you think is going on and why. That said, you needed the ECG to really know and we prompted you here.

2018-10-14|Dillan Radomske|F1|Robert A. Woods|Clinical Supervisor|3|Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1|emergency department, adult, complex patient characteristic, complex environmental characteristic, altered neurological status|"Dillan assessed a patient with fall down stairs/laceration to ear - Level II trauma.  I was in the room before he got there, and it was a bit chaotic - patient was intoxicated, was bleeding from the face and soiled themselves with feces.  I got the situation a little more controlled (directed the team to clean up the patient, put direct pressure on the wound) so we could start our assessment.  Dillan did an appropriate primary survey.  He was clear with his findings, his exam of each aspect of ABCDE was thorough and accurate.  

We discussed the decision making in this case.  I explained the importance of serial vitals and response to interventions.  The patient's initial BP was soft and was normal with a fluid bolus - this is very different than a normal/stable blood pressure.  His oxygen level was 91-92% initially, then 98% with 3L oxygen - once again this is very different than normal and stable.  Both of these abnormalities are likely explained by the facial bleeding and the intoxication/body habitus, however you do need to make note of them, and consider other injuries if your response to initial therapies are transient.

We also discussed the concept of risk/benefit in terms of CT head.  Because of his agitation, we would need to sedate +/- intubate him.  Given the relatively stable neuro exam/lack of localized findings, the chance of a surgical brain bleed is low.  His obesity and short neck/small chin make him a difficult airway.  Best approach in this situation is to wait until he sobers up and hope to either clear him clinically, or have him be cooperative enough on his own to do the CT without sedation.

We also discussed that suturing has multiple roles - hemorrhage control vs cosmesis.  His ear was bleeding profusely initially, and likely the cause of his soft BP.  Suturing the part of the wound to get hemorrhage control, then doing the rest of it later when they are more cooperative/c-collar off is a very appropriate strategy.  With bleeding - get the big bulky dressing off, find the bleeder and get direct sustained pressure on it."||FALSE

The patient was extremely challenging from a time/information perspective. I did prompt Dillan a bit regarding investigations in her workup and her ultimate treatment.

Recognizes the sick patient. I would suggest that his while his Ddx tends to be expansive (likely to show the instructor his breadth of knowledge). The downside of this approach is that his Ddx tends not to be 100% inclusive and is not ordered in terms of likelihood of the diagnosis. I.e. 18 month old, immunized, previously well with viral prodrome and barks cough. Ddx included viral croup, largyngomalacia, epiglottis, but did not include a statistically far more likely differential of foreign body, trauma, etc. The other comment is that his charting needs to be more succinct.

2018-10-18|Dillan Radomske|F2|Paul Olszynski|Clinical Supervisor|3|Part A: Direct Observation supported by indirect observation (case discussion) - Form 1|emergency department, adult, other|"This was a good case that highlighted a few major aspects of EM (foundational stuff). The first relates to hypothesis driven approach to patient work up which Dillan is starting to develop. Dillan's patient presented with non-cardiac chest pain (triggered by a cough, radiating throughout the chest, different from anginal pain in past, and spontaneously resolved). Dillan correctly developed a working differential that included MSK chest pain but kept in consideration the patient's recent NSTEMI. We briefly spoke about aortic dissection and Pulm embolism but both felt it was very low risk, thus not requiring CTA or d-dimer. We proceeded to work up the patient to rule out ACS (he used the HEART score and even (gently) corrected me on the new update of the 2nd trop in patients with low risk HEART scores). 2nd trop was negative and plan was to D/C home. At the end of the encounter, Dillan became aware of a BP measurement differential (20 mm HG between arms) and this caused some trepidation in terms of diagnosis and discharge.
Which leads us to the second point - dealing with uncertainty. I recognize that this is an actual EPA in transition to practice, but it is wirth mentioning now as it is something each EM trainee needs time to develop. Each of us will find our own comfort zone for uncertainty as EPs. Dillan currently chooses to investigate most patients as a means of developing his own test thresholds. I am inclined to allow this whenever a trainee has adequate reasons  (only once on the shift did we agree to cancel tests - this was a patient with allergies).  After discussing the BP issue the next day, and building on a previous conversation on use of D-dimer, i believe Dillan is aware of this key aspect of EM and is doing his best to develop his own test threshold and approach to patient & risk tolerance."||FALSE

Dillan performed a reduction of an apex solar both bones forearm fracture and required minimal assistance. He studied the X-rays prior to procedure and created a structured and sequenced plan to the reduction that worked. When casting in the future, make sure you minimize the thickness of the soft-roll by only ""doubling up"" layers so you can create properly localized pressure points to reduce -hash-the fragments.

Dillan reduced and casted an unstable distal radius fracture. Excellent job on the reduction. You clearly have a good understanding of the biomechanics to reduce a dorsally angulated distal radius fracture. Remember the in adults and elderly people, you don't need to mimic the deformity before you reduce the fracture like you do in paediatric fractures. This is because adults lack the thick periosteum that paediatric bones have that often can either get caught in the fracture site or act as a tension band one side of the bone requiring you to mimic the deformity then arc it into adequate alignment. Dillan's splints are coming along well. I have minimal concerns with his splinting technique in regards to distal radius fractures. He does a great job of ensuring he's given enough room for the 5th MCP to abduct and thumb to extend. He is also conscientious of not casting past the MCP's. When casting proximally, make sure you come all the way up just distal to the radial head which you generally do. When attempting the 3 point mold, you have the tendency to want to mold the distal radius by squishing it right between your hand and your knee. The first problem with this is that if yin compress the wrist anteriorly and posteriorly in the same spot you can compress neuromuscular structures leading to pain/parasthesias (secondary to an induced carpal tunnel syndrome), velour obstruction (leading to painful increased swelling and soft-tissue damage) and lastly compartment syndrome. Its important when performing your 3-point mold to ensure that your knee on the solar side of the forearm is midway between your hands on the dorsal side to avoid the above potential complications. Good job ensuring that your hand is molding directly over the fracture site. That us where you will be creating the mold that will hold the fracture fragment where it needs to sit and not move until follow-up."||FALSE

Dillan applied a 3-sides splint to a potentially unstable ankle fracture. Dillan’s splints are coming along very well. When placing the 2 stirrups and back slab, great job of ensuring you’re stopping just distal to the fibular head and at the metatarsal heads. When molding the splint, you have the tendency to want to mold over the medial malleolus. This is a common misunderstanding around the biomechanics of the ankle. We achieve adequate reduction of an ankle, place the lateral malleolus in the palm of one hand (this acts as a lateral buttress to support the fibula and lateral side of the talus. In turn, this will prevent lateral tibiotalar translation similar to what a non-fractured fibula acts like in a normal ankle. You will then place the palm of your other hand at approximately half way down the medial aspect of the tibia (this utilizes the tibia as a lever, where the knee is the fulcrum. This method allows you to swing the distal tibia back on top of the talus which is then stopped by the stable buttress you’ve created with you hand over the lateral malleolus. This lateral buttress acts similar to the way a door jam stops at door from swinging into the next room. Additionally, by having one hand below the syndesmosis (on the lateral mall, and one hand above – on the medial tibia), you get more compression across the syndesmosis (between distal fibula and distal tibia). I hope this helps."||FALSE

We will do our best to figure this out for you today, but given how early the pregnancy is, we many not be able to give a definitive answer.

He has self-identified a couple of potential deficiencies in his learning, namely proctored U/S scanning, intubations and PSA. As the former, comes up more frequently than the the two latter, he will make a point of recording his U/S scans for review (regardless of if +ve, -ve or indeterminate) and ensuring this is evaluated on shift.

WRT intubations and PSA unfortunately these come up infrequently and are not predictable. We discussed potentially seeing more ingestion and SOB cases as these have a higher frequency of intubation. Another option is to take a difficult airway course (i.e. AIME Advanced) or to do a difficult airway rotation at some point if he finds his skills/confidence is lacking. I suspect that over the course of his residency this will likely work out in the wash.

-ABG probably not necessary at all for this case. VBG would have been reasonable and faster, especially initially.
-ECG interpretation of sinus brady at 35 with no note of the ischemia. Required prompting for interpretation (although not really part of the EPA). Noted that he needed to actually go through his approach of ECG interpretation but didn't do that and therefore missed a finding he would have seen.

ECG is more important - impacts management.  Make sure you don't tax your nurse with too many things - orders get missed and they don't know which one is most important.

Rachit started CPR without checking a pulse - seeing VF on monitor.  Asked nurse to call code blue.  She hooked up monitors, called code blue, then set up to shock.  Started post-cardiac care - ECG, called CCU.  Phone call: could clean it up a bit - a bit disorganized and too narrative.  Stick with the punch line - '55 y o VF arrest in the ED, down for 2 minutes, came back after 1 shock, stable now, can you come and see please'.  During debrief we talked about the lack of pulse check - I think it was reasonable given the context of the case (no signs of life, VF on monitor, had already fainted).

Over the phone your focus was on circulation when his respiratory status was decompensating the most and I didn't appreciate that (chest hurt the most, sats were low).

Additional notes:
-The bed needs to go down for CPR (it was on an angle)

To take it a step further, before cardioverting ask the following: type of anticoagulation and whether they are compliant (NOAC) or have therapeutic INRs in the last month or whether the duration of symptoms is less than 24-48 hours.  Also ask whether or not they have had an ECHO, particularly those patients who have CAD.  We often see patients with HTN who do not have CAD and try Procainamide without truly knowing their EF, but a patient with a low EF might get quite hypotensive with it.

2018-08-03|Rachit Batta|F4|Robert A.

The patient stated they were unable to flex or extend their arm and it was numb distal to the wound.  I needed to prompt Rachit to take this preliminary exam with caution.  Anesthetizing the wound to manage analgesia/anxiety and waiting until more sober will both give a more reliable assessment of injury.  Once the wound was explored, I prompted Rachit to really explore the wound and put the elbow/forearm through functional movements to assess for muscle/tendon injury and remove foreign bodies.  I explained that even if Plastics or Ortho will need to see a patient with a complex wound, we still close it and they open it when they see the patient.  Consider setting up your room a bit better.  I got the patient to spin around on the bed so their right arm was accessible for the procedure.  Consider elevating the bed and standing, or getting a stool with an armboard/tray so you have better ergonomics for suturing.  These extra steps up front will save you time in a complex wound.  With large lacerations, close the middle half first to relieve tension and ensure you have the edges lined up.  Sometimes your first stitch has to be removed if it is not tight enough, but it often allows you to do subsequent sutures more easily.||FALSE

It was an asthmatic patient with an exacerbation secondary to URTI. I began my feedback with asking him to use the PRAM score to describe the physical exam. Rachit then interrupted me and said that he had charted the PRAM score before I asked him to do it when we were working through the case. I was not referring to charting the PRAM but referring to it when discussing and planning care for the patient in real-time. I told him if I wasn't aware that he had charted the scoring, and I apologized that I hadn't noted it. The feedback session had to be stopped given the persistence in which Rachit continued to defend his charting of the PRAM . I wasn't able to offer the positive feedback I had observed about that specific case. I had observed him to re-evaluate the patient frequently and spend appropriate time counseling the patient's family. His re-assessments of his patient improved vastly this shift from our last shift. He was thorough with the care of this patient and completed a number of tasks around discharge and follow-up. My recommendation to Rachit is to listen to feedback that is being given my attending, and then to offer comments/explanations etc after he has let the attending speak. I think this will then allow him to have a more productive feedback sessions.

Has an incisional hernia and has been seen recently and was to have follow up the next week with surgery. Dr. Carey and I discussed the decision to investigate or not with labs and CT scan and when to make those decisions. Most of the time, the decision for CT scan can be made on initial assessment and differential diagnosis. Only occasionally will it be changed when lab work is back and is not as predicted. Sometimes the doc needs time to make that decision (serial exams) in which lab work can be used to bridge that time. When I went back with Dr. Carey to examine the patient, she was quite tender and we elected to order the CT scan to r/o surgical abdominal pathology. The CT was unchanged so his initial decision to not do the CT scan would not have resulted in any patient harm. By discharge the patient's abdominal exam was much more benign. Would the patient have settled eventually without investigation or did the negative CT scan contribute to her reassurance? Always difficult to tell. We discussed thinking about the catastrophic but remote diagnoses and deciding if you have ruled them out sufficiently on initial assessment and asking yourself if you would sleep well at night if you sent them home without investigations. We also discussed developing gestalt by predicting the results of all investigations done and then if you are correct and recognize more patterns you may be more confident the next time.||FALSE

I find that Rob has a very approachable demeanour, which is important in simulation. He gave an excellent pre-brief. One thing that really stuck out for me was that he mentioned that simulation can be really stressful, but this is place to make errors, and there is no judgement based on this. He gave an example of doing simulation for pediatrics this morning and making errors himself. I found that this made the learners feel more comfortable and open to make decisions without feeling as vulnerable.
The only thing that I would add to the pre-brief is to note that students are allowed to use cards/phones/books during the scenarios to look up information"||FALSE
2019-04-03|Robert Carey|C18|Brent Thoma|Clinical Supervisor|5|Part A: Direct Observation - Form 4||"-I liked that you provided an overview of everything potentially within the topic and then narrowed it down to what you were going to talk about. Provided some perspective regarding what is missed.
-I liked the splitting of the group into junior and senior learners explicitly. A few people did not seem to 'caucus' with a group - thoughts on how you could have gotten them engaged?
-You had the resident do the quiz but I don't think you explicitly checked back in with them after that to see if there was a question that they struggled with? 2) or if they had any thoughts on any particular answers? I feel like if you ask them to do something like this it's good to reference back on it in the presentation (although I appreciate the time challenge in a 30m presentation).
-Good question-based approach to the questions. Sorry that I jumped in on so many of them!
-Work on your extra words. Specifically, you used 'again' a LOT of times as you went through your presentation. Being conscious of this and practicing it can help you get those out of your presentation vocabulary."||FALSE

2018-09-03|Robert Carey|P7|Brent Thoma|Clinical Supervisor|5|Part A: Review of resident submission - Form 4||"-Rob requires a bit more orientation regarding collaborator shifts. I let him know that I believe his first one would be due in the first 6 months of this year so he still has time. He noted he will talk to Rob about this and discuss with his peers to get additional details. 
-Rob is appropriately involved in interest-specific tasks outside of the formal residency program
-Rob has multiple scholarly projects going that he is interested in
-Rob is happy with his progress in CBD / the residency program. Upon reviewing his portfolio I was concerned regarding the small number of EPA's that had been completed in his current stage (Foundations). He noted that he understood that he was 'bridging' between the two phases, but I relayed concerns that with so few EPA's (5 in total for 4 EPA's; most at the level of 4 or 5) that the CC might want more data before promoting him to Core. He is on EM now and he will focus on acquiring more evidence for competency at the Foundations level prior to the meeting. 
-Things to work on moving forward (engaging in resuscitation rather than just helping) are reasonable. I have unfortunately not had a single shift with him to personally see how he is functioning clinically. He will be moving a shift this month to make sure we have one. 
-Had a good career discussion. He definitely wants to pursue additional training in MedEd. Discussed the Robert Maudsley Fellowship, the potential for a local MHPE program, as well as the Clinician Educator program. He is interested in doing Trauma or STARS when he finishes. We discussed potentially focusing his education projects that will be part of his masters on one of these areas and possibly doing a trauma or stars rotation in 3rd year to finalize his interest."||FALSE
2018-12-10|Robert Carey|P7|Brent Thoma|Clinical Supervisor|5|Part A: Review of resident submission - Form 4||"Rob and I met today to discuss his progress since his last 3-month review. At that time he wasn't promoted to Core due to a lack of evidence of sufficient progress through Foundations. He has made an effort on his emergency blocks to get additional Foundations EPAs assessed and has, in general, increased the rate at which he is acquiring EPAs. He has noted that Faculty seem to have some difficulty with EPA 2.1, often providing entrustment scores and ratings that seem more appropriate for 3.1.

He continues to have a desire to pursue education and, in particular, simulation as his niche. He is going to take the ASSET course in January and would like to further explore both the KidSim fellowship program and possibilities for Masters of Education degrees along with applications for the Robert Maudsley Fellowship.

He is working on several research projects with his primary residency project being with me and focusing on resident dashboards for CBD data.

He is generally keeping quite on top of his additional residency tasks."||FALSE

2019-03-11|Robert Carey|P7|Brent Thoma|Clinical Supervisor|5|Part A: Review of resident submission - Form 4||As indicated by Rob's self-assessment, I think he is making excellent progress. Specific note should be made of the additional teaching that he has been doing that is in line with his academic and career goals. He recently took ASSET and has been doing additional simulation teaching and curricular design along with other EM attendings. His research is also going well (I am his supervisor) and he is staying on top of the tasks that he has committed to. I find him to be a reflective learner that reflects on how he can improve regularly and accurately. He knows that he is behind on collaborator shifts, but is committed to getting them done before the end of the year. He also expressed a desire to focus more on 3.14 (ultrasound). From a career perspective, he is going to meet with some of the sim fellowship programs at CAEP as he has an interest in pursuing this along with a MMEd in his 4th year.  He is particularly interested in the Calgary / KidSim program.||FALSE
2019-06-10|Robert Carey|P7|Brent Thoma|Clinical Supervisor|5|Part A: Review of resident submission - Form 4||Rob is excelling in our program. He is keeping on top of all of his responsibilities, purposefully learning on rotation, and expanding his academic commitments while maintaining a reasonable balance with his personal life. He has several academic projects moving forward. We discussed the need to define his interests better to allow for him to select his priorities. He continues to see sim as a key component of this with a QI and education focus. He continues to plan on pursuing a simulation fellowship (hopefully in Calgary). He represented our program well at CAEP in both sim and sono games. Self-reflections attached.||FALSE
